You are an expert educator reviewing a classroom transcript. The transcript is labeled with the following teaching practices: Giving students opportunities to respond, Asking open-ended questions, Pressing students to explain, and Waiting after asking a question. Your goal is to choose the top 3 exemplar moments for each of the 4 teaching practices to surface to teachers in a lesson report.

Transcript format:
- Each speaker's turn is shown as SPEAKER: utterance
- Teaching practice instance annotations appear below relevant turns as:   - INSTANCE #{instance id} [practice label(s)]: "utterance within turn"
- [speaker talk for X seconds] indicates untranscribed speech
- When selecting exemplar moments for a specific practice, consider all instances that contain that practice label in their brackets

Teaching practice definitions:

Give students opportunities to respond (OTR):
When teacher asks students to verbally respond to a prompt or question.
Frequently giving your students opportunities to respond leads to more engaged students and fewer disruptions. It also gives you more chances to check for understanding.

Ask open-ended questions (OEQ):
Open-ended questions have many acceptable responses, unlike closed-ended questions which have a single correct answer.
Open-ended questions create more opportunities for students to talk, express thoughts in detail,  think critically, and engage in richer classroom discussions.

Press students to explain (PRESS):
When teacher asks a student to explain their thought process.
This highly effective practice helps students develop deeper conceptual understanding and better communication skills. It also helps you better assess their understanding and point of view.

Wait after asking a question (WAIT TIME):
Waiting at least 2.5 seconds after asking students to respond to a question.
This highly effective practice gives students time to organize their thoughts. It also gives a diversity of students the chance to respond, rather than just the first student to raise their hand.

Instructions:
1. Review all instances of each teaching practice (OTR, OEQ, PRESS, WAIT TIME) with context.
2. For each teaching practice, select up to 3 moments that best exemplify that practice. If fewer than 3 instances are available, select all present instances. Optimize for the following dimensions:
    - Pedagogical impact: Does the moment demonstrate clear educational value and impact on students?
    - Diversity & range: Do the 3 examples show different contexts, approaches, linguistic variety, and interactions with students?
    - Relevance to learning: How well does it connect to the lesson content and student learning?
    - Substance & depth: Does it provide meaningful content for teacher reflection (avoiding overly brief examples)?
    - Linguistic richness: Ideally, the selected utterance should be linguistically rich and demonstrate thoughtful use of language
    - (OEQ only): Does it involve high cognitive demand? A high cognitive level question asks students to do any of the following: explain, compare, assess, classify, interpret, infer, hypothesize, or synthesize. A high cognitive level question is NOT one which merely asks students for a report or recitation of facts, it is NOT a question that asks students to merely recall, recite, recognize, match, quote, report, label, list, memorize or identify something.
3. For each selected moment, generate:
    - Quote: the exact teaching practice instance quote.
    - Preceding context summary: A brief summary of the 10 seconds of context before the moment (focus on student talk and interactions).
    - Instance ID: The number after the # symbol corresponding to that teaching practice you're selecting the exemplar for (e.g., from "OTR #1" the instance ID is "1", from "OEQ #2" the instance ID is "2").
    - Following context summary: A brief summary of the 10 seconds of context after the moment (focus on student responses and engagement).
    - Post-quote description (1 complete sentence) explaining how it connects to lesson/student learning. Note: This description will be surfaced to the teacher whose recording is being analyzed to provide them with more context about the moment highlighted.
4. For each teaching practice type, provide a rationale explaining why the 3 moments, taken together, give a strong, diverse picture of that teaching practice.
